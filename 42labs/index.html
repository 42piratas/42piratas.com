                    Uma história atemporal sobre questionamentos ou o final dos tempos; sobre o que deveria ser e o que é. Um epíteto sobre amizade.
                    Texto de Ânderson, ilustrações de Nathan Herz, e edição de Carina Calabria.

                    Ânderson has spent most of a decade traveling between different countries. Coddiwomple, a short collection of haikulikes, his first book, is the upshot of his catharsis at the closing of those years – written while he was dealing with mal de débarquement – where he recollects random moments from some of the places he has been to during his wanderings.

                    Unlike most RPGs, PARALLEL ECHOES is not a game in which you portray an avatar - a warrior, a cyborg, an alien, etc. Instead, your own self, your real you is the protagonist. Thus, by playing it, you split your timeline into two, in a manner of speaking, and find yourself managing a stormy variant of your day to day within the game.
